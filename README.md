**C**ounterfactual **O**utcome **M**odels for **E**nhanced **T**ransplants
## Project description
This project aims to provide a platform to benchmark different counterfactual treatment outcome estimation algorithms in the setting of Organ Transplants. Moreover, It will serve as a tool that supports clinitians in the choice of an optimal patient/donor pair.
## Data
We will use synthetic data as a proof of concept and to benchmark the performance of counterfactual treatment outcome algorithms, but will design the tool to seamlessly integrate real-world organ transplant data.
